It looks like you are pushing a Java application: a #{build_file} file
was found in the application directory. The Cloud Foundry Java buildpack
expects compiled artifacts. When pushing your app, specify the path to the
artifact by using 'cf push -p /path/to/artifact' or adding
'path: /path/to/artifact' to your manifest file.
